  "summary": "The implementation addresses most requirements successfully. Search functionality, category filtering, currency conversion to INR, location management, restaurant expansion to 20+, 8 categories, View All page, and rating count displays are all implemented. However, menu item search (searching dishes within restaurants) appears incomplete based on truncated evidence.",

      "reason": "The HomePage search implementation filters restaurants by name and cuisines, but there's no clear evidence in the truncated HomePage.tsx that the search also matches against menu item/dish names within restaurants. The allRestaurants array contains restaurant data but no visible menu items array for searching.",
